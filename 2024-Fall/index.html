<h1>CS 7180 - Fall 2024 - The Structure and Interpretation of Deep Networks</h1>

<p>Tuesdays 11:45 AM - 1:25 PM and Thursdays 2:50 PM - 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>This course will be built around a review of the current literature in
   interpretable deep networks and deep network explanation methods. Topics may include:
<ul>
  <li>Salience methods: answering "what is the network looking at?"
  <li>Representation probing methods: "what is the network looking for?"
  <li>Causal methods: "what makes the network behave as it does?"
  <li>Model editing: "can we directly edit model parameters?"
</ul>

<p>The course will be designed for research-oriented grad students.
Because it is centered around student presentations, interactive demonstrations,
and discussions, it will be held in-person only.
<p>Students in the course will do three things:
<p>1. You will read and present current papers in machine
learning interpretation: "explainable AI," "interpretable AI,"
"mechanistic interpretability," etc.
<p>2. You will be responsible for creating an interactive demonstration
(E.g., a colab notebook) that uses or visualizes the methods in
a research paper, suitable for classroom use. During each class, we will
all use and learn from a notebook created by your fellow students.
<p>3. You will do a final project where you will need to
find a "customer" from a non-computer science field that
is touched by AI (e.g., a fellow student from CSSH or Biology
or etc.) and then create a demonstration applying model interpretation
methods to a problem setting relevant to them.
<p>At the end of the semester we will have a workshop where
we invite all the non-computer scientists to join and
see all the final project demonstrations.
</p>

<p>Prerequisites: CS 7150 or equivalent. You must be familiar with
training, fine-tuning, and using deep networks with pytorch, including
use in both natural language (transformers, RNNs, LLMs) and computer vision
settings (CNNs, GANs, VAEs, Diffusion models). You must be
comfortable with machine learning, linear algebra, gradient optimization
methods, and probability and statistics.
