<h1>CS 7180 - Fall 2024 - The Structure and Interpretation of Deep Networks</h1>

<p>Tuesdays 11:45 AM - 1:25 PM and Thursdays 2:50 PM - 4:30 PM in Ell Hall 410.</p>

<p>This course has two goals:
<ol>
  <li>Read and discuss current literature in interpretable deep networks
      (also known as "mechanistic interpretability", "interpretable AI"
      or "explainable AI".)
  <li>Collaborate to create a practical handbook that on mechanistic
      interpretability that can inform your future research.
</ol>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>CS 7150 or equivalent. You must be familiar with
training, fine-tuning, and using deep networks with pytorch, including
use in both natural language (transformers, RNNs, LLMs) and computer vision
settings (CNNs, GANs, VAEs, Diffusion models). You must be
comfortable with machine learning, linear algebra, gradient optimization
methods, and probability and statistics.

<p>The course is designed for research-oriented grad students.

<h2>Syllabus</h2>

<p>In each class we will discuss 2 or more specific papers:
<b>the detailed course schedule can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GyK9rWLTUjFR7YWJyB4lyUU9Qhhb-sGVILOCosLfhI0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</b>

<p>Our readings can be divided into four major modules.
During each module we will read about the research methods that
scientists use to answer specific questions about large AI models.

<ul>
    <li>Neural representations (Sept 12) - "How do neural networks represent information?"</li>
    <li>Internal computation (Oct 8) - "How do they perform algorithms?"</li>
    <li>Learning dynamics (Oct 29) - "How do they learn to generalize?"</li>
    <li>Understanding the world (Nov 19) - "How do they model the world?"</li>
</ul>

<p>On December 10 and/or 12, we will have a poster session day for students
to present their final projects.

<p>Because the seminar is centered around student presentations, interactive demonstrations,
    and discussions, it will be held in-person only. 

<h2>Course Structure</h2>

<p>Each enrolled student will help lead <b>two</b> classes during the term.

<p><b>When you lead, you will be on a team of 2-3 responsible for leading a
  discussion centered around the papers listed on the schedule.</b>
  The team of discussion leaders will collaborate to create four things
  before the class.
<ol>
  <li><b>Handbook page.</b>  Create a one-page webpage "handbook" presenting the most important ideas from the assigned papers, well-illustrated by figures and surveying the state-of-the-science on the topic.  This should be pushed to the repo at <a href="https://github.com/davidbau/sidn-handbook/">github.com/davidbau/sidn-handbook</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Handbook demo.</b> Create, find, link, and test a small running demo of a method from the paper that other students can run.  Your handbook should link to this demo, and if you write code, that code should also be pushed to the sidn-handbook repo.
  <li><b>Presentation.</b>  You will present the papers briefly to kick off the class; you may optionally use slides or you can just use your handbook to show visuals.  Your presentation should not be longer than 25 minutes (shorter is OK!) and should overview the same information that is in your handbook.
  <li><b>Discussion survey.</b>  Write three discussion questions, and post a Google Form on Piazza for other students to respond to before class.</li>
  <li><b>Discussion plan.</b> After students respond to your form, make a spreadsheet of all the submitted discussion answers, and sort them to preselect 5-10 discussion answers from specific students you want to discuss.  During the class, call on those students to kick off the discussion. (Also send the survey spreadsheet to Sheridan so that students can get points.)
</ol>

<h3>What should a "handbook" page cover?</h3>
<p>The original inspiration for this idea was the <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/pdectb.html">PDE coffee table book</a>,
which was a group project at Oxford with the goal of creating a beautiful book describing different partial differential equations.

<p>For our purposes, instead of creating PDF pages, we will ask you to contribute a webpage to the <a href="https://sidn.baulab.info/">sidn.baulab.info</a> website (which we will be 
building together throughout this course). You can think of it as a brief page in a "handbook" of interpretability topics, 
with practical workaday tips on how to get going on a topic, such as: 
<ul>
  <li>A one-sentence description of the problem is being solved and why</li>
  <li>Copied (with attribution) or created figures that best illustrate the ideas</li>
  <li>A brief explainer of any math you actually need to understand</li>
  <li>Opinionated pointers on what paragraph to read in which paper for what perspective</li>
  <li>Opinionated pointers to github or huggingface repositories containing code or data or models with notes on what quality they have</li>
  <li>An example piece of running code (demos are always great)!</li>
</ul>
<p>Your team's handbook page is due on the day of the class you are presenting.  Ideally you can and should work on your handbook pages well in advance of your classes, so that they are a resource for students to read before your class.

<h3>Handbook demos?</h3>

<p>Your handbook page link to running demo that other students can run to try out the ideas in the papers.

<p>In the ideal case, your team will select a single interesting method from the papers and create a clean and minimal implementation of a method that shows how it works in a small or simple case in self-contained colab notebook.  If you create your own demo, we encourage you to use the <a href=https://nnsight.net/">nnsight.net</a> library to implement the method.

<p>To demonstrate a complex method, your demo could be a curated choice of a pre-existing demo that is online, or it could be a short webpage describing exactly how to run an existing piece of code from a github repo, showing an explicit example of what input and output to use.

<p>In your class, you should show off your demo and explain how to run it.

<h3>Discussion survey?</h3>

<p>Two days before your class, you should post a Google form (<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hpjO2omHNVi7qU60ax0pKkfhJRgpwNU7_C0UySmuEcg/edit">template</a>) on Piazza with two discussion questions for other students to answer before class. It should also always contain a third question, "what question do YOU have about the reading?" to ask students to suggest their own discussion questions.
  To give the others enough time to respond, you should post your form sometime on Sunday if you're leading on Tuesday, and sometime Tuesday if you're leading on Thursday. 

<p>Student answers to your survey are due by midnight the night before class.
  At this point, you can pre-select 5-10 of the responses or questions that you found most interesting to disscuss. 
  After your presentation, you will drive the discussion by calling on students who suggested those answers or questions, asking them to discuss their points.
  Please create a spreadsheet of responses (including emails of all the responding students) 
  and mail this to our TA Sheridan so that we can give credit to all the students who have participated in the reading.

<h3>Slides?</h3>

<p>You are free to make slides for your presentation if they are helpful. But they are optional; your goal is to spark an interactive discussion rather than having a lecture. It is perfectly fine to present the topic by putting your handbook webpage on the projector and discussing the figures and the formulas.


<h2>Final Project</h2>

<p>For your final project, you will be asked to apply model interpretation
methods to a problem setting relevant to your own research interests. You will need to create
a website or latex report on your research, similar to the ones created for class discussions,
and make a poster explaining your ideas.  At the end of the semester we will have a poster
workshop where we invite other researchers to join and see all the final project demonstrations.

<h2>Grading</h2>
You will need to help run two classes throughout the semester, each of which will
count for 20% of your grade (40% total). 30% of your grade will be based on class participation
(e.g., reading the papers as evidenced by filling out the forms of questions requested by your classmates, coming to class and offering thoughts), and the last 30% will come from your final project.
